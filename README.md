# Employee Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes employee data from ABC Company using Python. 
The dataset contains 458 rows and 9 columns, providing information about employees across different teams.
The objective is to preprocess the data, perform various analyses, visualize key insights, and present a data-driven report.

## 📂 Files in the Repository
- **Python Project.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis.
- **Python Project.py** - Python script with all the necessary code.
- **cleaned_employee_data.csv** - Processed dataset after cleaning.
- **README.md** - This file, explaining the project structure and findings.

## 🛠 Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Replaced incorrect values in the `height` column with random numbers between **150 and 180**.
- Checked for **missing values** and **duplicates** to maintain data integrity.

### 2️⃣ Data Analysis
- **Employee Distribution by Teams**: Counted the number of employees in each team and calculated their percentage.
- **Position Segmentation**: Segregated employees based on their job positions.
- **Age Group Analysis**: Identified the predominant age group.
- **Salary Expenditure**: Found which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
- **Age vs Salary Correlation**: Checked if older employees earn higher salaries.

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization
We used `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to create the following visualizations:
- 📊 **Bar Chart** - Employee distribution by teams
- 📊 **Bar Chart** - Employee count by job position
- 📊 **Histogram** - Age distribution of employees
- 📊 **Bar Chart** - Salary expenditure across teams
- 📊 **Scatter Plot** - Relationship between age and salary

## 📈 Insights Gained
- The **largest team** in the company has the most employees.
- The **most common job position** is prominently present across teams.
- The **predominant age group** among employees is identified.
- The **highest salary expenditure** belongs to a specific team and position.
- There is a **correlation between age and salary**, showing trends in salary growth with experience.
